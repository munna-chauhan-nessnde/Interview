#Creational design patterns
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

#Abstract Factory
Creates an instance of several families of classes
#Builder
Separates object construction from its representation
#Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes
#Object Pool
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
#Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
#Singleton
A class of which only a single instance can exist

#Structural design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

#Adapter
Match interfaces of different classes
#Bridge
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
#Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
#Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
#Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
#Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
#Private Class Data
Restricts accessor/mutator access
#Proxy
An object representing another object

#Behavioral design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

#Chain of responsibility
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
#Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object
#Interpreter
A way to include language elements in a program
#Iterator
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
#Mediator
Defines simplified communication between classes
#Memento
Capture and restore an object's internal state
#Null Object
Designed to act as a default value of an object
#Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
#State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
#Strategy
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
#Template method
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
#Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change
